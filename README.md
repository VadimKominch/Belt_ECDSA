Implementation of STB 34.101.45-2013 ECDSA algorithm. Contains implementation of STB 34.101.31 - 2011 block encryption 
and hash algorithms.

Project contains some base algorithms for correct ECDSA work.
* belt-block
* belt-hash

Python implementation for these algorithms by [NeverWalkAloner](https://habr.com/ru/company/virgilsecurity/blog/301048/).
 
 TODO 
- [x] Rebuild belt-hash for more fast implementation
- [ ] Wrote second implementation for belt-block
- [ ] Implement modular multiplier
